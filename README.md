# Deep Learning for Comment Toxicity Detection  

ðŸš€ A deep learningâ€“based project that detects toxic comments such as **toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate**.  
This project uses **TensorFlow/Keras**, trained on the [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge), and deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive testing.

## âš¡ Features
- Preprocessing of raw comment text (cleaning, tokenization, padding).  
- Deep Learning model using **LSTM/GRU/Embedding layers**.  
- Multi-label classification for 6 toxicity categories.  
- Training pipeline with model saving/loading.  
- **Streamlit app** to test new comments interactively.
